# Student-Portal

Project Overview
1. You'll be given a JSON file, import that into your HTML and js project.(10 marks)

2. Create a UI as shown in Figma. (5 marks)

3. Map all the 100 elements in the table as shown. Ensure that the Name column has an image of the student and the full name. (first_name + last name). Also, the passing attribute is a boolean in the JSON, but in the table, you have to show either passing or failing. If passing is true, show passing; otherwise, if the Boolean is false, then show failed. (20 marks)

4. By default, the table will show the data in the order of the JSON file.

5. Make a search bar which searches and updates the table data. It should filter out on the bases of first name, last name, and email. And shouldn't be case-sensitive. (20 marks)

6. The search functionality can work on handleChange or use the search button click event to show the updated table data.

7. Then make a flexbox with all the buttons having even space between them. (5 marks)

8. On the click of the buttons, sort the array - do the following. (25 marks-> 5*5)

Sort A->Z means ascending order of full name.

Sort Z->A means descending order of full name.

Sort by marks means ascending order of marks.

Sort by passing means only showing students who are passing.

Sort by class means in the ascending order of class.

9. When you click on sort by gender, you show 2 tables, one containing all female students and the other containing all male students. Both should be shown, show them one below the other. (15 marks)
